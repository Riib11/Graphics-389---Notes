# GPU Programming

**GLSL**: The the shader language (c) that runs on the GPU.

Reading textures:
- vertex shaders (geometry / mesh calculations)
- fragment shaders (coloring of individual pixels). "placement"/"splatting" of color onto **frame buffer**.

GL with GLSL (or WebGL) allows shares to write directly into other buffers -> render into texture.
